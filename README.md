# 🚗 Car Detail and Management System

The **Car Detail and Management System** is a robust, full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of car information, service history, and user data. It's built on the **MERN stack** with a responsive and modern interface powered by **Tailwind CSS**.

-----

## 💡 Project Abstract

This system simplifies the management of car data, including model, brand, year, price, and service details. It supports both **administrator** and **customer** roles. Admins have full **CRUD** control over all car and user data, while customers can securely manage their personal car information and service records. The project focuses on the seamless integration of frontend and backend technologies, featuring secure **JWT-based authentication** and a user-friendly interface.

-----

## 🎯 Objectives

  * Design and develop a web-based system for comprehensive car detail management.
  * Provide a highly **responsive and modern UI** using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
  * Implement secure **user registration, login, and data management**.
  * Enable **CRUD operations** for cars and service records.
  * Ensure secure access control using **JWT-based authentication**.
  * Demonstrate full-stack integration across the MERN technology stack.

-----

## 🚀 System Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Features

  * **Full CRUD:** Add, edit, delete, and view all car details in the system.
  * Manage user records (optional advanced feature).
  * View comprehensive service history for each car.

### 🚗 User Features

  * **Secure Auth:** Register and log in securely.
  * Manage personal car information and updates.
  * View their car details and associated service records.
  * Receive instant feedback via **React Toastify** notifications.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack (MERN)

| Layer | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **React.js, Tailwind CSS** | Building the responsive UI, using utility-first styling. |
| **Backend** | **Node.js + Express.js** | Creating **RESTful APIs** and server-side logic. |
| **Database** | **MongoDB** | Flexible, document-based NoSQL database for data storage. |
| **Authentication** | **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | Secure, state-less authentication and authorization. |
| **Tools** | **Axios, Postman, dotenv** | API communication, testing, and environment variable management. |

-----

## 📐 System Architecture

The application follows the classic MERN architecture for clear separation of concerns:

**React.js (Frontend + Tailwind + Toastify)**
$$\downarrow \text{ (Axios)}$$
**Express.js + Node.js (Backend API)**
$$\downarrow \text{ (Mongoose ODM)}$$
**MongoDB (Database)**

### Frontend Components Overview

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Navbar** | Responsive navigation (Home, Cars, Login/Logout). |
| **Login/Register** | User authentication pages. |
| **CarList** | Displays all cars in responsive cards or a table. |
| **CarForm** | Form for adding or editing car details. |
| **ServiceList/ServiceForm** | Components to manage car service records. |
| **UserProfile** | Displays user’s profile and owned cars. |

## 🗄️ Database Design (MongoDB Schemas)

The database structure facilitates one-to-many relationships between Users, Cars, and Services.

### 🧾 User Schema

```json
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String, // Hashed
  role: { type: String, enum: ['admin', 'user'], default: 'user' }
}
```

### 🚗 Car Schema

```json
{
  brand: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  price: Number,
  owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  services: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Service' }]
}
```

### 🔧 Service Schema

```json
{
  car: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Car' },
  date: Date,
  description: String,
  cost: Number
}
```
